## Introduction

Planet Maths is my final project developed for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development course. It was designed following a simple set of guidelines - use a Django backend to create a website that allows for user CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality.

## Project Outline

Planet Maths was developed with the goal of allowing anyone to submit maths questions, for anyone to use for any reason - perhaps studying for exams, for smaller brain teasers, or otherwise. As a result, it should be accessible for all ages.

# UX Design

## User Stories

### A Note on Agile

For brevity, only the main text of each user story will be listed here. For full user stories (along with addition features not yet implemented), please visit the [project board](https://github.com/users/hpjohnson/projects/3). As of the creation of this readme, only the must haves are implemented.

### Must Have

* As a user I want to view a page of questions so that I can practice my maths skills.
* As a user / the site admin I want to be able to submit new questions to the website to help others learn.
* As a user I can register an account so that I may use more of the websites features.
* As the site admin I want an about page so that I may detail the site's goals and functionality.
* As a user I can edit my submitted questions so that I can fix mistakes, or make other improvements.
* As a user I can delete my uploaded questions.
* As the site admin I want the website to have attractive css styling, intuitive interactivity via javascript, and to follow modern accessibility and UX standards.

### Should Have

* As the site admin I want the about page to contain a development logging feature so that I may detail updates for the users.

### Could Have

* As a user I can manage my comments on questions for corrections/feedback.
* As a site user I want to be able to search questions by tags for easier question finding.
* As the site admin I want a feature that allows users to generate symbolic maths questions for practice.

### Won't Have

* As user I want to be able to select a variety of questions to create a question set, that I can download for offline usage.

## Theming

As this website aims to be able to collect questions from anyone worldwide, it seemed appropriate to use the word planet in the website's name. Colours were chosen to fit this goal - dark backgrounds for the blackness of space, and green + blue for main highlights representing the main colours of Earth.

All colours pass contrast checkers for accessibility - I used [WAVE](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) and [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/).
